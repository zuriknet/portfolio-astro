		<h2>Full Stack</h2>
		<p>I have many years experience working with creative directors and artists slicing up artwork 
			and writing markup as well as styling accordingly with css, sass or less to render the design 
			with pixel perfect precision as well as the experience necessary to stand up new virtual web 
			development environments.
		</p>

	<div class="stack gap-2 lg:gap-4">
		<Icon icon="trophy" color="var(--accent-regular)" size="2.5rem" gradient />
		<h2>Best Practices</h2>
		<p>I always follow ADA and WCAG guidelines to create accessible web projects that all users can access.
			I try to keep my code well organized, well indented and well spaced as well as well documented and well commented. 
			I also try not to repeat myself and make use of constants.</p>

		<Icon icon="strategy" color="var(--accent-regular)" size="2.5rem" gradient />
		<h2>Strategy-Minded</h2>
		<p>I am constantly learning, growing and eager to achieve all personal and professional goals. 
			Over the last 2 years I have personally	taught two teams of young adults HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, 
			web development and web applocation development. My goal is to make continous progress in my industry each year. </p>
