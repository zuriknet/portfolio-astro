I developed an custom intranet solution as well micro web-services for each of the different services that the intranet provide. Designed and developed company acronym tool, find-it-fast tool RedZone Frontend and RedZone API. A custom api which drives a frontend and database which serves over 4,000 field engineers vluable, emergency data 24 hours and day, 7 days a week for all business and wireless equipment orders. 

Later RedZone became golden source provider for RedZone Data throughout all applications within Verion so the data was consolidated and the application integrated into Verizon.com. 

I also designed and created a QA Request Tool which gathered information from Field Engineers needed to spot check an ISPEC and provided the QA Engineers a method for recording their spot checks in a single place that records notes and keeps the reporter, the team and managers updated with what everyone is doing via email and an interactive web user interface. 

During my tenure at Verizon I had the privalage to teach 2 groups of 2 high-school and 2 college level interns at Verizon where I instructed them how to create a web application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript / jQuery, PHP / Laravel and STRAPI Api's. Within 1 month the students helped me create a web form which can send the form data to a MySQL database and store the values inside of the database table and then renders that data onto a webpage. The students created their own presentations and delivered a presentation of a functional web applications to a large group of 20 Verizon employees.
