At GoodyGoody I work with a team of developers to create a new micro site in which the user will see two glasses animate and clink as the user scrolls the mouse wheel down. We used the clients creative direction to create the look and feel of the site as well as to implement some JS to capture the users location and provide the user with some custom content based on the users zip code.
