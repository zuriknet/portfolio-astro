> The Brands I Love! Work was a blast

At TracyLocke my manager gave me the PizzaHut, HutLovers email campaign. The project included getting the creative from the creative director and either slicing the creative or chopping up the creative and animating the html hero image or body of the email blast for the week. The creative was on brand and always follow the brand guidelines for PizzaHut. Once I proved myself as a developer, I also helped develop DownTownDallas.com and also helped with WingStreet. The work was so much fun!

> MailChimp, Liptnus, BrowserStack

During my employment at TracyLocke we employed the use of all sorts of technology to ensure that our HTML Emails met a certain criterial and also were styled a certain way so that everything always rendered the exact same no matter which email client the email was being viewed in. MailChimp helped us keep the code clean and be delivered rapidly to all many hundred of throusands of HutLovers. We also added in many styles that help to render the email in clients like GMail, Yahoo Mail, AOL Mail and Outlook also.
