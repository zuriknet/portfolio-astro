### SUCCESS Magazine

At SUCCESS Pertners I worked on an agile team working with brand content, creating custom API endpoints to deliver digital media to users. 

> Frontend Web Development 

I organized digital media content in many different platforms. Sliced artwork and layed in artwork into markup to render within a web education framework, microsite or clickfunnel.  

> Custom RESTful API's

Created custom api end points for different clients and loaded content URL into the clients custom content management system. Designed and developed proof of concept wireframes and templates for several different platforms. Assisted in quality control by picking up bugs from Jira and Proof Testing or UAT Testing and correcting the bug.
