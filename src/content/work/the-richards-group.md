# The Stand-Up

At TRG I worked as a front end web developer. It was an amazingly creative place to work but it was definately cut-throat, which I loved. We had Stairscase meetings at least once a month where everyone would gather in the center of the buildine around this enourmous staircase and gase onto the center of the building where the M.C. would rattle off the different awards, mentions and good tidings from the week before until building to the climax of Stan Richards getting the floor where he gave his speach and told everyone how important they are and thanked everyone for increasing value to the company.
 

>Where I learned Pixel Perfect Development

During my employment at TRG I was privlaged to work with some huge brands such as The HomeDepot, Chick-Fil-A, Pier1 Imports, The Salvation Army, SummersEve, Orkin, PediaLax, TGIFridays and so many more. Working for big brands such as those gave me the patients needed to moke minor adjustments many times over. The project management required everything to go through layer upon layer of creative revisions, legal revision and client revisions so be the time it the final release was pushed live, everything is absolutely perfect! Every moment counts and so it helped that this was an Agile shop. 

> Don't Repeat Yourself

Keep your code DRY..."Don't Repeat Yourself".
I learned a lot about the principal of reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstrsctions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place.
